<a name="welcome-to-the-nfs-ganesha-project" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-the-nfs-ganesha-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the NFS-Ganesha Project.</h3>

<p>The nfs-ganesha project is developing Open Source solutions for NFS and 9P based file servers.
The development of nfs-ganesha started at CEA, Paris, France as a solution to providing NFS access to their tape archive library.
It has grown into a full featured file server that supports NFSv3, NFSv4.0, NFSv4.1, and NFSv4.2. We have even thrown in 9P protocol support.</p>
